# Lazy Load Images
- Lazy load images with JS utilizing the [Intersection Observer API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Intersection_Observer_API)
  - `rootMargin` set to `200px` in the script, but can be edited/removed. Also `threshold` can be utilized instead to fire observer when some/all of the image has scrolled into view

## How to Use

2) Add `data-` to the src/srcset/sizes attributes

## Example
`<img data-src="img_src" data-srcset="img_srcset" data-sizes="img_sizes" alt="Image" class="lazy">`
